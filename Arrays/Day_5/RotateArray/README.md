## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

You're given an array of integers `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`.

Your task is to **rotate the array to the right by `k` steps**, meaning each element is shifted to the right by `k` places.

## ðŸ“¥ Input

- `nums`: List of integers
- `k`: Integer (number of steps to rotate, non-negative)

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output

- Rotated version of `nums` (in-place or returned depending on implementation)

---

## ðŸ§© Examples

### Example 1
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


Example 2

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
