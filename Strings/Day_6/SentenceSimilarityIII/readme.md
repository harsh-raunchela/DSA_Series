# 1813. Sentence Similarity III

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a sentence composed of words separated by single spaces (no leading or trailing spaces).

Two sentences are considered **similar** if you can insert an arbitrary sentence (including an empty one) into **either** of them such that both become **exactly equal**.  
The inserted sentence must be properly **separated by spaces**.
